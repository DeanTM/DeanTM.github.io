Not all the work we do ends up as open source code, online posts and how-tos. [Non-disclosure agreements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement) and the sometimes rapid pace of work means that frequently the only thing we have to show for a job hard done is a reference and a list item on a CV. That's where this page will come in: a place to scribble down other work I can tell you about.

If you wish to peek at [my github](https://github.com/DeanTM), you can. If you wish to know about some projects I've worked on, which you won't find there, then this is the place.

If you want to download my CV for print, there's a [copy here]({{site.url}}/downloads/CV.pdf).

This page, like most of the site, is not yet completed.
