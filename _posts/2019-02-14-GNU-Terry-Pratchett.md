description: a request for help with GNU Terry Pratchett

It goes without saying that Terry Pratchett's works has had an enormous influence on my life.  

As such, I wanted to play my part in honouring him with the [X-Clacks-Overhead](https://xclacksoverhead.org/).  

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to find a way to add the appropriate response header to this Jekyll site (I am familiar neither with Ruby nor with web development). The closest I've come to is finding a [ruby gem for rack applications](https://github.com/rmcfadzean/rack-pratchett) and [how to do it with Hugo](https://blog.rmhogervorst.nl/blog/2018/07/20/how-to-set-up-gnu-terry-pratchett-on-hugo-with-netlify/). I'm also new to Jekyll, learning it for Github pages.

I suspect there's a way to piece this all together via [rack-jekyll](https://github.com/adaoraul/rack-jekyll), but since I'll be relying for the next while quite heavily on jekyll themes and defaults to keep everything stable (at least until I've learnt Ruby and have a better grasp of customising Github pages) I'm not eager to tamper.

So far, I've included adapted the html head [appropriately](http://www.gnuterrypratchett.com/#HTML) (which you can probably see by pressing `<F12>` in your browser) but that won't show up with any browser extensions.  

If anyone has a better idea or advice on inserting the appropriate response header into a jekyll managed site, please drop me an [email](mailto:{{site.email}}).

PS. I would also like to give a shoutout to Rhianna Pratchett, who has worked on some [amazing games](http://www.rhiannapratchett.com/games.php).
